                The person leading the U.S. response to the <a href="" >coronavirus outbreak</a>, Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the U.S. Centers for
                Disease
                Control and Prevention, is preparing herself and her family for a possible pandemic that could cause “severe”
                disruption
                to everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools possibly close, and social gatherings are discouraged.
                “I had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning,” Messonnier said today in a conference call with
                reporters. “And I told my children that while I didn’t think that they were at risk right now, we as a family need
                to be
                preparing for significant disruption to our lives.”
                Messonnier, who directs the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, sounded the most
                concerning
                tone yet that COVID-19, as the disease is called, will likely become a pandemic. “The fact that this virus has
                caused
                illness and death, along with sustained person-to-person spread is concerning,” she said. It meets two of the
                criteria
                for a pandemic. Meanwhile, she said, “the world moves closer to meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the
                new
                virus.”

            <blockquote>
                “We really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that their lives will be disrupted because of
                this
                pandemic.”
            </blockquote>

                That would seem to be already the case. Community spreading — cases that appear without a known source of exposure —
                are
                now occurring in Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

                “Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,” Messonnier said. It’s no longer a question of
                if,
                she says, but when and how many people will become severely ill.
